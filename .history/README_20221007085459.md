# Project Modules

The repository contains global modules that are called by other projects in this GitHub account.
Modules like calling , populating or closing a json , excel or pdf file.
These modules may use external modules as well but they have specified towards
this specific use case and generally for Quantitative Analysis.

## Why?

The reason for separating these modules is they increasing get complex and 
no one want to keep copying a pasting functions or writing a new function 
altogether hence the need to separate and generalize/standardize them.

## Installation

-Clone the modules in your local machine 

-Call them in the code as you would call any other module

## Usage

'Open+" "' refers to modules that opniong of files 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mnapoli/project-template.git my-project
cd my-project
# Remove the git repository metadata
rm -rf .git/
# Start a brand new repository
git init
git add .
```

Easy peasy! Now you just have to code.

Make sure your examples work by testing them! I didn't test mine and I should feel ashamed.

# Project Modules

The repository contains global modules that are called by other projects in this GitHub account.
Modules like calling , populating or closing a json , excel or pdf file.
These modules may use external modules as well but they have specified towards
this specific use case and generally for Quantitative Analysis.

## Why?

The reason for separating these modules is they increasing get complex and 
no one want to keep copying a pasting functions or writing a new function 
altogether hence the need to separate and generalize/standardize them.

## Installation

-Clone the modules folder to your local machine 

-Call them in the code as you would call any other module or use
the sys.path.append method

```bash
  
path = "/Users/adamszequi/Desktop/Clones/UniversalModules"
sys.path.append(path)
from ExternalModules import modulesSmartFactor

```
## Usage

'Open+" "' refers to modules that open files 
'Close+" "' refers to modules that close files 

The 'compoundedAnnualGrowthRate' function calculates the annual growth rate using a linked return method ie. returns that have been multiplied by each other to create a compound return.The returns are compounded for the end of the investment period ie. the  portofolio is assumed to be rebalanced at this period eg. quarterly, annually etc.Fomulas use here  are  
$$linked return^t = (r^t * r^{t-1})$$
$$linked return^{t+1} = linked return^t * r^{t+1}$$
$$total linked return = linked return final -1$$ 
$$CAGR = (total linked return)^{1/t}$$

where r  is the annual return /log annual return
where t is the number of periods
This function takes a dataframe as inputs and returns a CAGR value.

This functions calculates the dollar value return on investments  given a particular CAGR. It uses the standard time value of future investments formula :
$$FV = I*(1+\frac{r}{n})^{(n*t)}$$
The valueOfXInvestedWithoutDividends function takes the principal, compunding frequency, total time of investments and annual growth of returns as inputs. It returns the dollar value of return on investments.

The '' calculates  the mean return when rolling three-year periods that the  strategy outperforms the Universe. That is, if an investor followed the  strategy for three consecutive years, what percentage of times would the  investor outperform the Universe? This functio takes a dataframe as inputs and returns another dataframe as with 
    rolling mean column as output. 
    N.B The dataframe has to contain a dat as index for it work.

## Installation

Describe how to install the project/library/framework/â€¦

Make sure your installation instructions work by testing them!

## Usage

Describe how to use the project. A gif or a short code example is the best
way to show how it works. Also keep paragraphs short and sentences simple: not
everybody speaks english well.

For the sake of the example here is how you can use this project template
as a basis for your own repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mnapoli/project-template.git my-project
cd my-project
# Remove the git repository metadata
rm -rf .git/
# Start a brand new repository
git init
git add .
```

Easy peasy! Now you just have to code.

Make sure your examples work by testing them! I didn't test mine and I should feel ashamed.

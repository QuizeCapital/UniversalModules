# Project Modules

The repository contains global modules that are called by other projects in this GitHub account.
Modules like calling , populating or closing a json , excel or pdf file.
These modules may use external modules as well but they have specified towards
this specific use case and generally for Quantitative Analysis.

## Why?

The reason for separating these modules is they increasing get complex and 
no one want to keep copying a pasting functions or writing a new function 
altogether hence the need to separate and generalize/standardize them.

## Installation

-Clone the modules folder to your local machine 

-Call them in the code as you would call any other module or use
the sys.path.append method

```bash
  
path = "/Users/adamszequi/Desktop/Clones/UniversalModules"
sys.path.append(path)
from ExternalModules import modulesSmartFactor

```
## Usage

'Open+" "' refers to modules that open files 
'Close+" "' refers to modules that close files 

The 'compoundedAnnualGrowthRate' function calculates the annual growth rate using a linked return method ie. returns that have been multiplied by each other to create a compound return.The returns are compounded for the end of the investment period ie. the  portofolio is assumed to be rebalanced at this period eg. quarterly, annually etc.Fomulas use here  are 
```{math}
:label: my_label
linked return^t = (r^t * r^t-1)



linked return^t+1 = linked return^t * r^t+1
total linked return = linked return^tfinal -1
CAGR = (total linked return)^1/t

where r  is the annual return /log annual return
where t is the number of periods
This function takes a dataframe as inputs and returns a CAGR value.
